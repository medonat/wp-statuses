# WP Statuses

WordPress leader acts [here](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine-banned/) and [here](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/10/secure-custom-fields/) are incompatible with my personal ethics and should also be incompatible with the ethics of an organization powering ~4/10 Internet sites. I decided to stop contributing to the WordPress software, WP Plugins/Themes, well everything that is part of Mattâ€™s Web.

Feel free to take over/fork this plugin & many thanks to the people who contributed to it!

This WP Plugin is no more supported by @imath and this repository is now archived.
